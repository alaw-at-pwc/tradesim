Things to add:
- bots considering what open orders they have

Things to fix:
- Urgent fix required around rebalacning the parameters in each decision tree
- Look to fix botlogic.py so it can be used as a script to import in, for ease of navigation
- what happens when user crosses best bid/ask by multiple price levels

Things to tweak:
- how bots decide quantity and price level to place order 
- parameters around calculation of asset/capital ratio
