Things to add:
- bots considering what open orders they have
- IB traders having the possibility to receive client orders - should differentiate into prop and agency traders? 
- for RI and PI traders, split out into different categories so you have risky and less risky participants, which rely on different trees more than others

Things to fix:
- Urgent fix required around rebalacning the parameters in each decision tree 
    - 03/07 - fixed so that orderbooks are more balanced, although further testing is likely needed
    - 04/07 - orderbooks seem to be more balanced, but become increasingly top heavy as the simulation progresses 

Things to tweak:
- how bots decide quantity and price level to place order 
    - 04/07 - made bots have their own ways to decide quantity and price level. however, much of this is still up to chance
    - Should add a form of strategy, maybe encourage more executions to cause more variation in the price 
- parameters around calculation of asset/capital ratio 
    - 03/07 - made some changes but needs to be more rigorously tested
- improve and change the logic for each unique decision tree to fit that profile
    - 04/07 - made some amendments so that trees are more unique, but can be improved further 
- probabilities of various market states 
    - 04/07 - seems to make more sense, and it does not cause the market to runaway as often as it did before 


Completed items:
- Look to fix botlogic.py so it can be used as a script to import in, for ease of navigation
    - 03/07 - seems to have fixed itself. will look to improve this but having multiple separate scripts to improve visibility
    - 04/07 - fixed this, ensure to add disclaimer to clone repository. split out into multiple files now
- what happens when user crosses best bid/ask by multiple price levels
    - 03/07 - tested and seems okay, although the market price indicates that the order price is the market price, need to test to see if it is reflective, and whether the transaction log accurately records the transactions
    - 04/07 - issue has been fixed
- Fix is required around an output file being produced, as well as the simulation not ending on the timer (if selected)
    - 04/07 - this has been fixed now
- Fix on user updates to front end, and correctly updating df_participants after user executes in the market
    - 05/07 - fixed so that user profile is updated correctly
- certain bots having the ability to place multiple orders at once 
    - 04/07 - added this functionality in so all bots can should they want to, but not all bots have the ability to generate restuls to do this (only IB and MM currently)
- system that updates the graph so that the candlesticks change and represent incresinsgly longer increments of time
    - 05/07 - completed this. but chart will break if the sim is run for more than an hour
